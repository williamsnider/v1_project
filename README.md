# v1_project
Code for creating a GPU-accelerated model of the mouse primary visual cortex

## Current Progress
- Constructed prototype model v1_only with the ~230,000 nodes from the GLIF dataset
- Added synaptic connections between each of these v1 neurons (~70,000,000 connections)
- Added an initial stimulus to excite node 0, which causes runaway excitation in the rest of the model
- Ran a quick simulation 



## TODO
1. Improve synaptic connections of v1_alone model
